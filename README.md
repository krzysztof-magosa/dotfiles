# Krzysztof Magosa's dotfiles

## Usage
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/krzysztof-magosa/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles  
bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

## Git
To prevent people from accidentally committing under my name I have personal
git options moved to separate file ~/.gitconfig-local. Don't forget to set your
details there :)

```
[user]
    name = "Your Name"
    email = "your.email@example.com"
```
